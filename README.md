# Code Alpha Task 2 - Music Player named "Spot My Music"

This project is part of my internship program at **CodeAlpha**. The task was to create a fully functional **Music Player** with dynamic browsing capabilities and a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Automatic Song Browsing:** The player dynamically fetches songs online through a customized API, eliminating the need for manual additions.
- **Playback Controls:** Includes interactive buttons for:
  - **Play**
  - **Pause**
- **Download Option:** Users can download the currently playing track directly from the player.
- **Album Artwork Display:** Automatically fetches and displays album images for a visually rich experience.
- **Song Metadata Display:** Shows the song title, artist name, and album details dynamically.
- **Playlist Navigation:** Allows users to browse through songs easily.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience on mobile screens.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive layout with a focus on usability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the application.
- **CSS** for styling and creating a responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for functionality, dynamic content fetching, and API integration.

## How It Works
1. The music player uses a customized API to fetch songs, metadata, and album images automatically.
2. Users can interact with playback controls to manage their listening experience.
3. The design adapts to various screen sizes, providing a mobile-first responsive layout.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
